        	<p>From the edge of the pond she took some mud and shaped it in the form of a human being. At first her creation was lifeless, and she set it down. It took life as soon as it touched the soil, however, and soon the human was dancing and celebrating its new life. Pleased with her creation, NÃ¼ Wa made more of them, and soon her loneliness disappeared in the crowd of little humans around her.</p>

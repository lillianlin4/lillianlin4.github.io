These are a couple of pages from a book I created with Simon Wu, where we morphed, played, cut up, moved around, disrespected re-arranged, twisted and broke down the Chinese characters from what we learned in the classroom. Our main medium of exploration was experimentation. Over the summer of 2015, while both of us were in Beijing, we had regular weekly meetings to play games. We had a different exercise every week. We did these exercises in tandem with our own Chinese education, as a means of processing and exploring how we learn the language. As beginners, our understanding of Chinese was so shallow that we were able to play around with the language through purely visual means with the ignorance of someone who doesnâ€™t know many words, or the semiotics behind words. Through this, we hoped to find alternate systems of meaning, unlock information hidden within the characters and the language, and come to a fuller understanding of our relationship to it.
